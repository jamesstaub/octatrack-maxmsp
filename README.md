Max MSP tools for working with Elektron Octatrack

A Max MSP patch for interfacing with the Elektron Octatrack.

The main use case this patch solves is triggering Pickup machines. The patch is setup with a UI to record and manage pickup machine loops on tracks 1-4.

A generalized UI is provided for sending/receiving Scene and Crossfader data, and mapping Max presets to the current bank + pattern number of the Octatrack. To use this project, unlock the main patch connect send/receives to relevant parameters in a max patch you'd like to interface with the Octatrack.

This project is a work in progress. Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you experience bugs or have feature requests.
